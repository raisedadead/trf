# Deployment

The system runs on the Workers Free plan.

## 1. The branch model

| Branch | Site            | Worker | Trigger                 |
| ------ | --------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| `main` | none            | none   | never                   |
| `live` | `rupeefund.org` | `trf`  | the maintainer, by hand |

Cloudflare Workers Builds watches `live`. Its build command is `pnpm run build`, its deploy command is `npx wrangler deploy`, and non-production branch builds are off. Leave them off. Every branch build would keep the production bindings.

Pull requests go to `main`. A merge deploys nothing. Do not run `wrangler deploy` by hand. It uploads whatever `dist` holds and skips the build guards. `pnpm wrangler rollback` is fine in an incident, because it ships no new code.

## 2. How to prove a change

You prove every change on your own machine. No test reaches the live database.

```sh
pnpm db:reset     # build the local database from the migrations
pnpm preview      # build to dist-preview, then serve it with wrangler dev
pnpm check        # types, lint, astro check, vitest
pnpm test:e2e     # Playwright against the local build
```

`pnpm preview` uses the always-pass Turnstile test pair, so the form completes with no real widget. Read the local rows:

```sh
pnpm wrangler d1 execute trf-rupeefund --local --command "SELECT email, consent_at FROM waitlist"
```

## 3. How to promote

Make sure CI passed on the commit. Then fast-forward `live`:

```sh
git fetch origin
git push origin <sha>:live
```

Use `main` as `<sha>` to take the tip of `main`. Do not force the push. `live` is always a prefix of `main`, so a promote takes a commit and everything before it. Promote often.

To go back, run `pnpm wrangler rollback`, then purge the zone cache. Do not delete the Worker. A deleted Worker loses its custom domain and every earlier deployment.

## 4. How to apply a migration

The deployment applies no migration. You apply each one by hand, in this order:

1. Export the live database.
1. Apply the migration to the live database.
1. Fast-forward `live`.

```sh
pnpm wrangler d1 export trf-rupeefund --remote --output /tmp/trf-backup.sql &&
  pnpm wrangler d1 migrations apply trf-rupeefund --remote
```

Keep the `&&`. It stops the apply when the export fails.

**Make each migration additive.** During a promote two Worker versions read the one live database. Add a column with a default or with NULL permitted. A change that removes a column needs two promotes: one that stops the code from reading it, and a later one that drops it.

Wrangler matches a migration by file name only. A changed file that has run does nothing. A reused file name runs nothing and reports no error. `tests/migrations/replay.test.ts` refuses the retired names. `wrangler d1 migrations list` proves only that the names agree. To check the schema, query the tables:

```sh
pnpm wrangler d1 execute trf-rupeefund --remote --json --command \
  "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ORDER BY name"
```

## 5. Secrets and variables

| Kind               | Home                       | Key                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Public build value | `src/lib/turnstile.ts`     | the Turnstile sitekey                     |
| Worker secret      | `wrangler secret`          | `TURNSTILE_SECRET`                        |
| Worker variable    | `vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` | `TURNSTILE_HOSTNAMES`, `TURNSTILE_ACTION` |

The Workers Builds settings hold no variable. One Turnstile widget serves the site, and its domain list holds `rupeefund.org` only. To rotate the sitekey, change the constant in `src/lib/turnstile.ts` and promote. Set the secret with:

```sh
pnpm wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET
```

For local work, one `.env` file at the top of the repository holds the test values. Do not also make a `.dev.vars` file, or wrangler ignores `.env`.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
printf 'dotenv\n' > .envrc && direnv allow
```

`.env.example` ships the always-pass test sitekey with `PUBLIC_ALLOW_TEST_SITEKEY=true`. Keep it that way for local work. Never set that opt-in in the Workers Builds settings. A deployed build with the test sitekey refuses every signup, and `pnpm run build` exits 1 before and after `astro build` when it finds one.

## 6. How to verify a deployment

Purge the zone cache first. Then:

```sh
curl -s https://rupeefund.org/api/health                       # {"ok":true}
curl -s https://rupeefund.org/subscribe | grep -o 'data-sitekey="[^"]*"'
curl -sI https://rupeefund.org/ | grep -i -e content-security-policy -e strict-transport
```

The sitekey must not be `1x00000000000000000000AA`. Complete the form one time, then read the row:

```sh
pnpm wrangler d1 execute trf-rupeefund --remote --command "SELECT email, consent_at FROM waitlist"
```

## 7. How to remove a person

A removal request comes by email to `rupeefund@fossunited.org`. There is no endpoint. Mark the row:

```sh
pnpm wrangler d1 execute trf-rupeefund --remote --command \
  "UPDATE waitlist SET unsubscribed_at = unixepoch() * 1000, updated_at = unixepoch() * 1000
   WHERE email = 'someone@example.com' AND unsubscribed_at IS NULL"
```

The mark is permanent. The exporter skips the row, and a new signup does not change it. Do not delete the row, or the next signup adds it again. To add the person again, clear `unsubscribed_at` by hand.

## 8. How to export the list

The command reads the local database unless you pass `--remote`.

```sh
pnpm list:export --remote --dry-run > list.csv   # prints the CSV, changes nothing
pnpm list:export --remote > list.csv             # prints the CSV, then stamps exported_at
```

The first line of the file is `email,name,attributes`. The `attributes` column is JSON with `source`, `consent_at`, `signed_up_at`, and `updates_opt_in`. The amount, the months, and the question stay in the database.

The export is incremental. Each row goes out one time. A row that an operator edits by hand after its export does not go out again. The command needs Node 22.18 or later, and wrangler login for `--remote`.

## 9. How to move to a different account

1. Make the database with `pnpm wrangler d1 create`. Copy the `database_id` into `wrangler.jsonc`.
1. Apply every migration to it with `pnpm wrangler d1 migrations apply trf-rupeefund --remote`.
1. Make one Turnstile widget for `rupeefund.org`. Put its sitekey in `src/lib/turnstile.ts`, and set its secret with `wrangler secret put`.
1. Add the `rupeefund.org` custom domain in that account.
